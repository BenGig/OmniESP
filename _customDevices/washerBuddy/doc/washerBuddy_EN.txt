WasherBuddy
===========

Pin standards are for Wemos D1 R2 (mini).

Supports 2 sensors:

 1. Water sensor for flooding protection
 2. Acceleration sensor for notification at the end of a washing programme

Water sensor can be anything that pulls a pin (default: D7) to low if water
is detected.

Accelerometer has to be of type MPU6050 (GY-521), connected via pins SCL (D1)
and SDA (D2).

This devices uses offset settings for X, Y and Z acceleration. The presets given
may be less appropriate for your device. The library for the MPU6050 by Jeff
Rowberg contains a calibration sketch (IMU_Zero [1]), which can give you better
values. These values can be entered in the web interface, reboot to activate
the new settings.

I doubt the statements are correct which say the output is measured in 'g'.
Since there are no better information, this unit is still used.

The 3D models in directory 'models' are suitable for standard 6x4mm boards.
